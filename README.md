# chatclientandserver
these are my college projects which were awesome few years ago.
Now I have included a file for how to compile it and want to progress the same thing over.
I want to build an android app for the same, 
using plain linux and sockets api to voice over IP through no server but dont know how to begin directly from one phone to another plain and simple with little knowledge to know whats my ip
after IPv6 each device can have there own IP so we can directly communicate over IP and internet,
